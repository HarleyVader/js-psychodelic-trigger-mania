**mega hard**  
im made bambisleep.chat AI GF.  
KatieGirl made spiral. i adapted it  (issues with my obsbot...)   
by ripping out eye tracking.  
put it into [bambisleep.chat AI GF](https://bambisleep.chat)  
Riped out Trigger+Spiral  
Spiral was made as fullscreen as posible.  
refresh browser window once you put browser in fullscreen  
it should move right to put spiral+text in centre & hide triggers
